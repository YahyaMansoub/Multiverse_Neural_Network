# MELANGE

This directory is dedicated to **cross-language neural network experiments** where different programming languages are merged to create exotic hybrid implementations.

## Purpose

The MELANGE (French for "mixture/blend") area is where we explore:
- Cross-language neural network architectures
- Polyglot implementations that leverage strengths of different languages
- Language interoperability experiments
- Hybrid performance optimizations

## Ideas for Cross-Language Projects

- Python + C: Use Python for high-level logic and C for performance-critical computations
- Java + Go: Combine JVM ecosystem with Go's concurrency model
- Multi-language pipelines: Train in Python, deploy in C++
- FFI experiments: Foreign Function Interface between languages
- WebAssembly bridges: Compile multiple languages to WASM for unified execution

**Note**: This is an experimental area. Feel free to break conventions and try unconventional approaches!
